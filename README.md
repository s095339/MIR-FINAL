## 1 introduction
This project aim to build a karaoke scoring system using python as the Final Project of MIR.
The system contains main subsystemï¼š

1. Source Separation: Separates vocal and accompaniment from original song input (.wav, .mp3 etc.)

2. Song Database: Stores the original song file , vocal, accompaniment gained from source separation module and pitch array generated from Vocal pitch recognition.

3. Vocal Recorder: Record vocal (our sining) with Microphone input and play the accompaniment at the same time.

# Requirements
For running SourceSeparation, type it in command line:
>python.exe -m pip install -U demucs

For recording voice:
>pip install pyaudio
# Source Separation
For Source Separation, you can import your song and get the vocal and accompaniment by enterring

> python main.py -mode i -song_path path/to/your/song 

Then, under the Database dir, a folder named by your song is created. A vocal.wav and the accompaniment.wav generated by the Source Separation model are stored in that folder.


TODO:
>Apply the vocal pitch recognition to the vocal to get the pitch list. Next, store it in the same dir in .txt format.
